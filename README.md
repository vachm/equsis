Distribution of NE probability in spatial data

Subroutines are attached to the study "Stochastic estimation of Nash equilibrium in land use and other spatial data" and are written in Fortran 90 to calculate the distribution of Nash equilibria probability between cases defined in spatial data.
In spatial data of any type, a set of individual cases can be defined. The cases can represent, for example, various rates of occurrence of selected characteristics.
A server that can calculate the NE probability distribution in spatial data that can be represented by up to 32 dedicated cases and a maximum of 5 interacting entities is available at equsis.com.
