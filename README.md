Distribution of NE probability in spatial data

Subroutines are attached to the study "Stochastic estimation of Nash equilibrium in land use and other spatial data" and are written in Fortran to effective calculation the distribution of Nash equilibria probability between cases defined in spatial data.
In spatial data of any type, a set of individual cases can be defined. The cases can represent, for example, various rates of occurrence of selected characteristics.
Proposed approach allowing the calculation of the probability distribution of NE, e.g., in landuse and other spatial data, could contribute to solving the problem of analysis and potential optimization of land cover,e.g., in terms of ecological stability, etc.
Calculation for up to 32 dedicated cases and a maximum of 5 interacting entities can be practically done and checked on the application equsis.com.
